### Divide and Conquer (D&C) Overview

**Divide and Conquer** is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem. The key steps are:

1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer**: Solve the subproblems recursively.
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to solve the overall problem.

---

### 1. **Quick Sort**

**Concept**: Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two subarrays:
- Elements smaller than the pivot.
- Elements larger than the pivot.

The subarrays are sorted recursively, and the sorted subarrays are combined.

**Algorithm**:
1. Choose a pivot (commonly the last or a random element).
2. Partition the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are on its left and larger elements are on its right.
3. Recursively apply the same process to the left and right subarrays.

**Code**:
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) - 1]
    left = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x <= pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right]

# Example usage
arr = [8, 4, 7, 3, 1, 9]
sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

---

### 2. **Merge Sort**

**Concept**: Merge Sort divides the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

**Algorithm**:
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the sorted halves into a single sorted array.

**Code**:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    sorted_arr = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            sorted_arr.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_arr.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    sorted_arr.extend(left[i:])
    sorted_arr.extend(right[j:])
    return sorted_arr

# Example usage
arr = [8, 4, 7, 3, 1, 9]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

### 3. **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication**

**Concept**: Strassen's algorithm improves the time complexity of standard matrix multiplication \( O(n^3) \) to approximately \( O(n^{2.81}) \) by reducing the number of scalar multiplications.

**Algorithm**:
1. Divide each \( n \times n \) matrix into four \( n/2 \times n/2 \) submatrices.
2. Compute seven matrix products using specific combinations of submatrices.
3. Combine the results to get the final product matrix.

**Code**:
```python
def strassen_multiply(A, B):
    if len(A) == 1:
        return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0]]]

    n = len(A)
    mid = n // 2

    A11 = [row[:mid] for row in A[:mid]]
    A12 = [row[mid:] for row in A[:mid]]
    A21 = [row[:mid] for row in A[mid:]]
    A22 = [row[mid:] for row in A[mid:]]
    
    B11 = [row[:mid] for row in B[:mid]]
    B12 = [row[mid:] for row in B[:mid]]
    B21 = [row[:mid] for row in B[mid:]]
    B22 = [row[mid:] for row in B[mid:]]
    
    M1 = strassen_multiply(add(A11, A22), add(B11, B22))
    M2 = strassen_multiply(add(A21, A22), B11)
    M3 = strassen_multiply(A11, subtract(B12, B22))
    M4 = strassen_multiply(A22, subtract(B21, B11))
    M5 = strassen_multiply(add(A11, A12), B22)
    M6 = strassen_multiply(subtract(A21, A11), add(B11, B12))
    M7 = strassen_multiply(subtract(A12, A22), add(B21, B22))
    
    C11 = add(subtract(add(M1, M4), M5), M7)
    C12 = add(M3, M5)
    C21 = add(M2, M4)
    C22 = add(subtract(add(M1, M3), M2), M6)
    
    return combine(C11, C12, C21, C22)

# Helper functions for addition, subtraction, and combination of matrices
# Add detailed implementations as needed.
```

### 4. **Convex Hull (Graham’s Scan)**

**Concept**: Convex Hull is the smallest convex boundary that encloses a set of points in 2D space.

**Algorithm**:
1. Find the point with the lowest y-coordinate (break ties by x-coordinate).
2. Sort the points based on the polar angle with the reference point.
3. Use a stack to maintain the vertices of the convex hull.

**Code**:
```python
def convex_hull(points):
    points = sorted(points)
    lower, upper = [], []
    
    for p in points:
        while len(lower) >= 2 and cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], p) <= 0:
            lower.pop()
        lower.append(p)
    
    for p in reversed(points):
        while len(upper) >= 2 and cross(upper[-2], upper[-1], p) <= 0:
            upper.pop()
        upper.append(p)
    
    return lower[:-1] + upper[:-1]

def cross(o, a, b):
    return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])

# Example usage
points = [(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 4), (0, 4), (2, 2)]
hull = convex_hull(points)
print("Convex Hull:", hull)
```

---

### 5. **Binary Search (Divide and Conquer in Searching)**

**Concept**: Binary Search divides the sorted array into halves to locate the target element.

**Code**:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7
index = binary_search(arr, target)
print(f"Element found at index: {index}")
```

Each of these examples demonstrates the essence of Divide and Conquer and its application to different problem types. Let me know if you want further elaboration or have specific questions about any topic!

### Greedy Methods in Detail

A **Greedy Algorithm** builds a solution step by step, always choosing the next step that provides the most immediate benefit, without worrying about the global optimum. While it doesn't work for all problems, it is very effective for problems where local choices lead to a global optimum. Below are detailed explanations and examples of important greedy problems.

---

### 1. Activity Selection Problem

**Problem Statement**:
You are given `n` activities with start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

**Greedy Choice**:
Always select the activity with the earliest finish time, as it leaves the maximum room for subsequent activities.

**Steps**:
1. Sort the activities by their finish times.
2. Select the first activity (it finishes the earliest).
3. For subsequent activities, select only those whose start time is greater than or equal to the finish time of the previously selected activity.

**Algorithm**:
```python
# Function to perform activity selection
def activity_selection(activities):
    # Sort activities by finish time
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Initialize the list of selected activities
    selected = [activities[0]]
    last_finish = activities[0][1]

    # Iterate through the remaining activities
    for start, finish in activities[1:]:
        if start >= last_finish:  # Non-overlapping condition
            selected.append((start, finish))
            last_finish = finish

    return selected

# Example usage
activities = [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6), (6, 7), (5, 9), (8, 9)]
result = activity_selection(activities)
print("Selected activities:", result)
```
**Output**:
```
Selected activities: [(1, 3), (4, 6), (6, 7), (8, 9)]
```

---

### 2. Task Scheduling Problem

**Problem Statement**:
You have several tasks, each with a specific processing time. Schedule them to minimize the total weighted completion time.

**Greedy Choice**:
Schedule tasks with the smallest processing time first (Shortest Job First).

**Steps**:
1. Sort the tasks by their processing times.
2. Execute tasks in this order, accumulating the completion time for each task.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def task_scheduling(tasks):
    # Sort tasks by processing time
    tasks.sort()
    
    # Variables to store total and cumulative completion times
    completion_time = 0
    total_time = 0

    for task in tasks:
        completion_time += task
        total_time += completion_time

    return total_time

# Example usage
tasks = [2, 4, 1, 3]
print("Total weighted completion time:", task_scheduling(tasks))
```
**Output**:
```
Total weighted completion time: 20
```

---

### 3. Fractional Knapsack Problem

**Problem Statement**:
Given weights and values of `n` items, maximize the total value you can carry in a knapsack of capacity `W`. Fractional parts of items can be included.

**Greedy Choice**:
Pick items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first.

**Steps**:
1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item.
2. Sort items by this ratio in descending order.
3. Pick items until the knapsack is full, possibly including a fraction of the last item.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def fractional_knapsack(items, capacity):
    # Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] / x[0], reverse=True)
    
    total_value = 0

    for weight, value in items:
        if capacity >= weight:
            total_value += value
            capacity -= weight
        else:
            total_value += value * (capacity / weight)
            break

    return total_value

# Example usage
items = [(10, 60), (20, 100), (30, 120)]  # (weight, value)
capacity = 50
print("Maximum value in knapsack:", fractional_knapsack(items, capacity))
```
**Output**:
```
Maximum value in knapsack: 240.0
```

### 4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

An MST is a subset of a graph’s edges that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight.

#### **Prim’s Algorithm**
**Greedy Choice**: Extend the MST by selecting the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

**Steps**:
1. Start with an arbitrary vertex.
2. Repeatedly add the smallest edge connecting the MST to a new vertex.

**Algorithm**:
```python
import heapq

def prim(graph, start=0):
    mst_cost = 0
    visited = set()
    min_heap = [(0, start)]  # (weight, vertex)

    while min_heap:
        weight, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if u in visited:
            continue
        
        mst_cost += weight
        visited.add(u)

        for v, w in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (w, v))

    return mst_cost

# Example usage
graph = {
    0: [(1, 2), (3, 6)],
    1: [(0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 8)],
    2: [(1, 3), (3, 5)],
    3: [(0, 6), (1, 8), (2, 5)]
}
print("Prim's MST cost:", prim(graph))
```
**Output**:
```
Prim's MST cost: 10
```

---

#### **Kruskal’s Algorithm**
**Greedy Choice**: Always pick the smallest edge that doesn’t form a cycle.

**Steps**:
1. Sort all edges by weight.
2. Iteratively add edges to the MST, skipping edges that form cycles.

**Algorithm**:
```python
def kruskal(edges, n):
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by weight
    parent = list(range(n))
    rank = [0] * n

    def find(u):
        if parent[u] != u:
            parent[u] = find(parent[u])
        return parent[u]

    def union(u, v):
        root_u, root_v = find(u), find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]:
                parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif rank[root_u] < rank[root_v]:
                parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                parent[root_v] = root_u
                rank[root_u] += 1

    mst_cost = 0
    for u, v, w in edges:
        if find(u) != find(v):
            union(u, v)
            mst_cost += w

    return mst_cost

# Example usage
edges = [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3), (0, 3, 6), (2, 3, 5), (1, 3, 8)]
print("Kruskal's MST cost:", kruskal(edges, 4))
```
**Output**:
```
Kruskal's MST cost: 10
```

### 5. Single Source Shortest Paths

#### **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
**Greedy Choice**: Expand the shortest known distance from the source to its neighbors.

**Algorithm**:
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, src):
    distances = {v: float('inf') for v in graph}
    distances[src] = 0
    min_heap = [(0, src)]  # (distance, vertex)

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if current_distance > distances[u]:
            continue

        for v, weight in graph[u]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distance
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (distance, v))

    return distances

# Example usage
graph = {
    0: [(1, 4), (2, 1)],
    1: [(3, 1)],
    2: [(1, 2), (3, 5)],
    3: []
}
print("Shortest paths:", dijkstra(graph, 0))
```
**Output**:
```
Shortest paths: {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 4}
```

---

### 6. Huffman Coding

**Problem Statement**:
Construct an optimal prefix-free code for characters based on their frequencies.

**Greedy Choice**: Merge the two smallest frequency nodes.

**Algorithm**:
```python
import heapq

def huffman(frequencies):
    heap = [[weight, [char, ""]] for char, weight in frequencies]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while len(heap) > 1:
        low1 = heapq.heappop(heap)
        low2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for pair in low1[1:]:
            pair[1] = '0' + pair[1]
        for pair in low2[1:]:
            pair[1] = '1' + pair[1]
        heapq.heappush(heap, [low1[0] + low2[0]] + low1[1:] + low2[1:])

    return sorted(heapq.heappop(heap)[1:], key=lambda x: (len(x[1]), x[0]))

# Example usage
frequencies = [('a', 5), ('b', 9), ('c', 12), ('d', 13), ('e', 16), ('f', 45)]
print("Huffman Codes:", huffman(frequencies))
```
**Output**:
```
Huffman Codes: [['f', '0'], ['c', '100'], ['d', '101'], ['a', '1100'], ['b', '1101'], ['e', '111']]
```

        else:
            total_value += value * (capacity / weight)
            break
    return total_value

items = [(60, 10), (100, 20), (120, 30)]  # (value, weight)
capacity = 50
print(fractional_knapsack(capacity, items))
```

##### 16. **What is Kruskal’s Algorithm? Explain briefly.**
**Answer:**
Kruskal’s Algorithm builds an MST by sorting all edges by weight and adding edges to the tree while avoiding cycles.

**Steps:**
1. Sort edges by weight.
2. Add edges to the MST if they don’t form a cycle.
3. Repeat until MST contains (V-1) edges.

##### 17. **Write Python code for Kruskal’s Algorithm.**
**Answer:**
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size

    def find(self, node):
        if self.parent[node] != node:
            self.parent[node] = self.find(self.parent[node])
        return self.parent[node]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u, root_v = self.find(u), self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

def kruskal(edges, num_nodes):
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    uf = UnionFind(num_nodes)
    mst = []
    for u, v, weight in edges:
        if uf.find(u) != uf.find(v):
            uf.union(u, v)
            mst.append((u, v, weight))
    return mst

edges = [(0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 5), (2, 3, 8)]
num_nodes = 4
print(kruskal(edges, num_nodes))

##### 18. **Explain Dijkstra’s Algorithm.**
**Answer:**
Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all others by iteratively selecting the nearest node and updating distances.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize distances from the source to all nodes as infinity, except the source itself.
2. Use a priority queue to pick the node with the smallest distance.
3. Update distances to its neighbors.

##### 19. **Write Python code for Dijkstra’s Algorithm.**
**Answer:**
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    min_heap = [(0, start)]

    while min_heap:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[
