Creational design patterns are concerned with the process of object creation, ensuring flexibility and reuse of code. These patterns abstract the instantiation process and provide different ways to control the creation of objects. Letâ€™s discuss the requested patterns in detail, one by one.

---

### 1. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
#### **Definition**:
The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is often used to create objects that share a theme.

#### **Key Points**:
- Encapsulates a group of individual factories.
- Promotes consistency among objects in a family.
- Helps in creating different products that are related or have a similar structure.

#### **UML Diagram**:
```
AbstractFactory
    |-- ConcreteFactory1
    |-- ConcreteFactory2
AbstractProductA         AbstractProductB
    |-- ProductA1         |-- ProductB1
    |-- ProductA2         |-- ProductB2
Client
```

#### **Implementation in Python**:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Factory
class GUIFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_checkbox(self):
        pass

# Concrete Factory 1
class WindowsFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return WindowsButton()

    def create_checkbox(self):
        return WindowsCheckbox()

# Concrete Factory 2
class MacOSFactory(GUIFactory):
    def create_button(self):
        return MacOSButton()

    def create_checkbox(self):
        return MacOSCheckbox()

# Abstract Products
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

class Checkbox(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

# Concrete Products
class WindowsButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering a Windows Button"

class MacOSButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering a MacOS Button"

class WindowsCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering a Windows Checkbox"

class MacOSCheckbox(Checkbox):
    def render(self):
        return "Rendering a MacOS Checkbox"

# Client
def client_code(factory: GUIFactory):
    button = factory.create_button()
    checkbox = factory.create_checkbox()
    print(button.render())
    print(checkbox.render())

# Example usage
factory = WindowsFactory()  # Switch to MacOSFactory() for macOS
client_code(factory)
```

#### **Advantages**:
1. Ensures a family of related objects is used together.
2. Promotes consistency across objects.
3. Abstracts instantiation logic.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. Adding new families of products requires extending all factories.
2. Increases complexity.

---

### 2. **Builder Pattern**
#### **Definition**:
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

#### **Key Points**:
- Step-by-step construction of objects.
- Useful when constructing a complex object requires multiple steps.

#### **UML Diagram**:
```
Director
    |
Builder (Abstract)
    |-- ConcreteBuilder1
    |-- ConcreteBuilder2
Product
```

#### **Implementation in Python**:
```python
# Product
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parts = []

    def add_part(self, part):
        self.parts.append(part)

    def show_parts(self):
        return f"Car parts: {', '.join(self.parts)}"

# Builder
class CarBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.car = Car()

    def add_engine(self):
        self.car.add_part("Engine")

    def add_wheels(self):
        self.car.add_part("Wheels")

    def add_body(self):
        self.car.add_part("Body")

    def get_result(self):
        return self.car

# Director
class Director:
    def __init__(self, builder: CarBuilder):
        self.builder = builder

    def construct_sports_car(self):
        self.builder.add_engine()
        self.builder.add_wheels()
        self.builder.add_body()

# Client Code
builder = CarBuilder()
director = Director(builder)
director.construct_sports_car()
car = builder.get_result()
print(car.show_parts())
```

#### **Advantages**:
1. Provides control over the construction process.
2. Enables building different representations of the same object.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. Requires separate builder classes for different products.
2. May increase the number of classes.

---

### 3. **Factory Method Pattern**
#### **Definition**:
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

#### **Key Points**:
- Subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- Focuses on a single product.

#### **UML Diagram**:
```
Creator
    |-- ConcreteCreator
Product
    |-- ConcreteProduct
```

#### **Implementation in Python**:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Product
class Button(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self):
        pass

# Concrete Products
class WindowsButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "Windows Button"

class MacOSButton(Button):
    def render(self):
        return "MacOS Button"

# Creator
class Dialog(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        pass

    def render(self):
        button = self.create_button()
        return button.render()

# Concrete Creators
class WindowsDialog(Dialog):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return WindowsButton()

class MacOSDialog(Dialog):
    def create_button(self) -> Button:
        return MacOSButton()

# Client Code
def client_code(dialog: Dialog):
    print(dialog.render())

# Example usage
dialog = WindowsDialog()  # Change to MacOSDialog for macOS
client_code(dialog)
```

#### **Advantages**:
1. Promotes code reuse.
2. Decouples object creation from the client.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. Can lead to a proliferation of subclasses.

---

### 4. **Prototype Pattern**
#### **Definition**:
The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This avoids the cost of creating a new object from scratch.

#### **Key Points**:
- Useful for cloning objects with complex structures.

#### **Implementation in Python**:
```python
import copy

# Prototype
class Prototype:
    def __init__(self, name, attributes):
        self.name = name
        self.attributes = attributes

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

# Client Code
prototype = Prototype("Original", {"key": "value"})
clone = prototype.clone()
clone.attributes["key"] = "new_value"
print(prototype.attributes)  # Original remains unchanged
print(clone.attributes)      # Modified clone
```

#### **Advantages**:
1. Reduces the need for multiple classes.
2. Efficient for resource-intensive objects.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. Requires implementing cloning logic for each class.

---

### 5. **Singleton Pattern**
#### **Definition**:
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

#### **Key Points**:
- Useful for managing shared resources like configuration or logging.

#### **Implementation in Python**:
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance

# Client Code
singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()
print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # True
```

#### **Advantages**:
1. Controls object creation.
2. Saves memory.

#### **Disadvantages**:
1. Can introduce global state.
2. Difficult to test in multi-threaded environments.
