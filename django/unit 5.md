### **Creating a Functional Website in Django**

A **functional website in Django** involves setting up the necessary components such as models, views, templates, and static files. Here's a quick breakdown:

1. **Install Django**:
   You can install Django via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

2. **Create a Django Project**:
   Create a new Django project using:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

3. **Create an App**:
   After the project is created, you can create a Django app where the main functionality will live:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

4. **Define Models**:
   In your app, define models that represent the data structure for your website. For example:
   ```python
   # myapp/models.py
   from django.db import models

   class Post(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       content = models.TextField()
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   ```

5. **Create Views**:
   In the `views.py` file, define the logic to display your content. For example:
   ```python
   # myapp/views.py
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .models import Post

   def home(request):
       posts = Post.objects.all()
       return render(request, 'home.html', {'posts': posts})
   ```

6. **Setup Templates**:
   Create a `templates` directory in your app or project and set up your HTML files to display data.
   ```html
   <!-- myapp/templates/home.html -->
   <h1>Posts</h1>
   {% for post in posts %}
       <div>
           <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
           <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
           <small>{{ post.created_at }}</small>
       </div>
   {% endfor %}
   ```

7. **Set Up URLs**:
   Define the URLs for your views in `urls.py`:
   ```python
   # myproject/urls.py
   from django.urls import path
   from myapp import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', views.home, name='home'),
   ]
   ```

8. **Run Server**:
   Run the development server to check if everything works.
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### **Four Important Pillars to Deploy a Django Website**

1. **Source Control (GitHub)**:
   GitHub serves as the version control system where you push and pull your code. This is essential for collaborating and tracking changes.

2. **Database**:
   Your Django application requires a database for storing and retrieving data. You’ll often use PostgreSQL or MySQL for production, and SQLite for development.

3. **Web Server (Gunicorn)**:
   Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server that allows Django to interact with a web server like Nginx or Apache.

4. **Hosting (Heroku)**:
   Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment of web apps, including Django projects. It automates the setup of web servers, databases, and more.

### **Registering on Heroku and GitHub**

1. **Registering on GitHub**:
   - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account if you don’t have one.
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for your project.

2. **Registering on Heroku**:
   - Visit [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign up for an account.
   - After signing in, you can create a new app in the Heroku dashboard.

---

### **Push Project from Local System to GitHub**

1. **Initialize Git**:
   In the root directory of your project, initialize git and link it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Push Code to GitHub**:
   After committing changes locally, push the updates:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

---

### **Working with Django on Heroku**

1. **Install Heroku CLI**:
   Install Heroku CLI from [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. **Create a Heroku App**:
   In the terminal, navigate to your project folder and run:
   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```

3. **Configure Heroku with Django**:
   - Add a `Procfile` to specify how to run your application.
     ```bash
     web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install gunicorn dj-database-url psycopg2
     ```
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     ```
   - Add the following settings to `settings.py`:
     ```python
     import dj_database_url
     DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config()
     ```

4. **Push to Heroku**:
   Deploy your Django app to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku master
   ```

5. **Migrate Database**:
   After deployment, run database migrations on Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

### **Working with Static Root**

Django handles static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) with a special directory called `STATIC_ROOT`. When deploying to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Static Files in `settings.py`**:
   ```python
   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
   ```

2. **Collect Static Files**:
   Before pushing to Heroku, run the `collectstatic` command to gather static files:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

3. **Add Staticfiles to `Procfile`**:
   Make sure your `Procfile` includes the command to serve static files:
   ```bash
   web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi
   ```

---

### **Handling WSGI with Gunicorn**

1. **Install Gunicorn**:
   Gunicorn is the WSGI HTTP server used for running Django applications in production. Install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Add Gunicorn to `Procfile`**:
   In the `Procfile`, ensure you specify Gunicorn to serve your application:
   ```bash
   web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi
   ```

3. **Run Gunicorn Locally**:
   You can test Gunicorn locally before deploying:
   ```bash
   gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application
   ```

---

### **Setting Up Database & Adding Users**

1. **Set Up Database on Heroku**:
   Heroku provides PostgreSQL by default. You can add it using:
   ```bash
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Database in `settings.py`**:
   Use `dj-database-url` to configure the database:
   ```python
   import dj_database_url
   DATABASES['default'] = dj_database_url.config()
   ```

3. **Run Migrations on Heroku**:
   After setting up the database, run migrations to create necessary tables:
   ```bash
   heroku run python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Adding Users**:
   - To create superusers on Heroku, use:
     ```bash
     heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

### **Conclusion**

These steps guide you through the essential tasks of creating a Django website, preparing it for deployment, pushing it to GitHub, and deploying it to Heroku. Once deployed, ensure you configure the database, static files, and WSGI server correctly. If you follow these steps, you’ll have your Django application running smoothly in a production environment.
